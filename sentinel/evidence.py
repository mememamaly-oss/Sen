"""SENTINEL v2.8.0 — Evidence Graph & Impact Assessment (Phase 56).

Every verified finding already carries its raw evidence chain and its
verification record. This module turns those parts into two professional
artifacts:

  1. IMPACT PROOF — a per-class statement of what the vulnerability lets an
     attacker DO, with the grade:
       * "proven"      — the scan demonstrated the impact itself, safely
                         (differential oracles, OOB callbacks, marker reads).
       * "indicated"   — the defect is confirmed but impact was not directly
                         exercised (banner/passive classes).
     The statements are class-accurate and NON-DESTRUCTIVE by construction:
     SENTINEL proves capability (a boolean oracle flips, a callback arrives,
     a computed value appears, a victim's marker is readable) without ever
     extracting real data, writing state, or executing destructive payloads.

  2. CHAIN OF CUSTODY — an ordered, auditable chain from detection to proof:
     request -> evidence -> verification -> impact. The chain rides every
     finding dict (additive "impact" key), so a report reader can walk from
     the vulnerability to exactly what proved it.
