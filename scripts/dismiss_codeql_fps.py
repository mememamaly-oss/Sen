"""CodeQL alert dismissals (owner order 2026-10-31, part 4.8 follow-up).

Dismisses the alerts that the 2026-10-31 triage classified as
false-positives-by-context, each with its documented reason. Alerts fixed
in code (#31 readLogTail, and the ReDoS trio after the caps) close
themselves when the next main-branch analysis runs — they are NOT
dismissed here. Token comes from the GITHUB_TOKEN env (inline only).

Exit 0 = all attempted dismissals succeeded; non-zero lists failures.
