# INTEGRATION TEST RUNNER (audit 2026-10-23) — the supported path.
#
# Why a bash runner: the integration suite needs the real Next.js dev
# server. Spawning the server from inside `bun test` proved unreliable in
# sandboxed environments (child-process trees can observe stale file
# content); a bash-managed server + attached test suite is deterministic.
#
# P2-D (2026-10-31): the platform DB is PostgreSQL. Two supported modes:
#   1. DATABASE_URL already provided (CI service container) — used verbatim.
#   2. local dev — scripts/pg_dev_start.sh --reset provisions a FRESH local
#      cluster + database (drop + create) on 127.0.0.1:55432.
# The schema is built with `prisma migrate deploy` (the REAL migration
# files — every integration run re-validates them end to end).
#
# Steps: fresh PG database -> migrate deploy -> boot dev server -> wait
# ready -> run bun test against it -> always kill server -> exit with the
# test's exit code.

# P2-D: the platform DB is PostgreSQL. The runner accepts a ready DATABASE_URL

# the local dev cluster for anything else (unset, sqlite leftovers, garbage —
# dev sandboxes re-inject stale env between commands, so the check is by
# PROTOCOL, never by mere presence).

# --- warm the public routes BEFORE the suite -----------------------------------

# run 41149783779: '/' timed out at exactly 5000ms while every warmed route
# passed). The runner's contract is a READY server — ready means the routes
# the suite hits are compiled, not just the process listening. One shared
# deadline (240s) bounds the whole phase; a route that cannot compile at
# all surfaces fast through the suite instead of hanging here.

# --- run the attached suites ---------------------------------------------------
# Each test file runs in its OWN sequential bun invocation: bun test
# parallelizes FILES within one invocation, and the suites share one
# database + one server (a parallel beforeAll races the bootstrap). Exit
# codes aggregate — any red file fails the run.
