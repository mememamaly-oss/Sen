"""SENTINEL v4.3.0 — hash/crypto artifact chain phase (GTP-10, upgraded GTP-12c).

Two whole Benchmark categories (hash: 236, crypto: 246) never put the
digest/ciphertext in the response — the servlet WRITES it to a server-side
artifact (passwordFile.txt in the app's working directory) and echoes only
the plaintext. Black-box the value is invisible... unless the same app
carries a FILE-READ primitive, in which case the artifact is readable
through it. This phase chains the two:

  leg 0 (truncate): GTP-12c — the read primitive's window is the artifact's
                  FIRST 1000 bytes and every request to a hash/crypto
                  servlet APPENDS a line, so the scan's own battery traffic
                  exhausts the window mid-scan (the round-4 bound: chain
                  validated end-to-end on a controlled pair, 0 findings on
                  the full target). A VERIFIED write-capable sink
                  (FileOutputStream family, append=false) pointed at the
                  artifact opens it and closes WITHOUT writing — the open
                  alone truncates the file to zero (live-proven: read after
                  truncate returns 'Range [0, 0 + -1] out of bounds'). The
                  app's own launcher truncates the same artifact at boot
                  (GTP-10 fixture hygiene); this is the same operation,
                  on demand, before every probe cycle.
  leg 1 (write):  submit a KNOWN marker value to a hash/crypto-shaped
                  endpoint ("hashed and stored" / "encrypted and stored"
                  response gates — real apps say the same words).
  leg 2 (read):   read the artifact through a VERIFIED path-traversal
                  file-read primitive on the same app, from a bounded
                  wordlist of conventional artifact names.
  oracle (hash):  the artifact's appended hash_value line base64-decodes to
                  EXACTLY md5(K) or sha1(K) computed locally — a digest
                  match is cryptographic proof of the weak algorithm
                  (SHA-256+ endpoints never match either).
  oracle (crypto): GTP-12c three-tier block analysis on the fresh
                  secret_value line:
                    T1  16-byte plaintext -> 24-byte ciphertext = an 8-byte
                        BLOCK cipher (DES/DESede family) on direct-param
                        surfaces;
                    T2  8/16/24-byte plaintexts whose ciphertexts are ALL
                        length==0 (mod 8) with EXACT +8 steps = the 8-byte
                        block signature on ANY input shape (the raw-stream
                        servlets prepend 'name=' to the body — absolute
                        lengths shift, the signature does not; AES-GCM/CCM
                        answers pt+tag, never 0 mod 8 on these lengths);
                    T3  64-byte uniform plaintext -> any REPEATED 8- or
                        16-byte ciphertext block = ECB mode (deterministic,
                        pattern-preserving — DES/ECB and AES/ECB alike).

VR-27/VR-28 re-execute the full chain with fresh markers (truncate
included); every finding cites BOTH legs (write endpoint + read primitive)
in its evidence chain.
