"""SENTINEL v4.3.0 — weak random chain phase (GTP-09).

Runs after the active battery loop. For every endpoint whose response SETS
an application cookie (non-container), the phase classifies the value shape
and attempts to BREAK the generator that produced it:

  decimal-fraction cookies  -> Math.random()/nextDouble shapes.
    Family A (chain prediction): Math.random() is ONE static JVM generator
    — two observed cookies determine the 48-bit LCG state; the phase
    PREDICTS the third cookie's digits BEFORE fetching it. A match is
    mathematical proof of a time-seeded LCG (SecureRandom fails prediction).
  long-integer cookies      -> nextLong shapes (full 48-bit state exposed).
  base64 ~16-char cookies   -> nextBytes shapes (80 bits exposed).
    Family B (seed-relation attack): new Random() per request seeds with
    seedUniquifier ^ nanoTime and the uniquifier advances by an exact
    multiplicative constant — two exact states + the shared CLOCK_MONOTONIC
    window (agent-mode, same host as the target) solve for (u, t1, t2);
    a third cookie confirms the solved relation forward. SecureRandom
    satisfies the relation with probability ~2^-38 per window.

Honest limits (documented, never silently glossed): nextInt (32/48 bits) and
nextFloat (24 bits) cookies are listed as NOT RECOVERABLE; Family B requires
the clock-shared deployment (remote targets: family stays silent).
